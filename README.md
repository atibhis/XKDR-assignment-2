This repository creates an app on Streamlit to visualize legal data available.

To run the app, run:
```
streamlit run app.py
```
Here, `app.py` is the python script that executes the code for the app. On running the command, a webpage of app.py will open wherein there are two pages - Overview and Detail. In the Detail page, the user can sort through the data using the following inputs.

- `Case Typology` : Original SUITS | Original Commercial Suits
